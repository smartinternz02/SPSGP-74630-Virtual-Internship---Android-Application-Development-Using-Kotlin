# Dear smartinternz02
Recently my win 11 OS is crashed & applications can't work properly and data cannot share manually if try OS shutdown automatically, it shares only through mails and whatsapp only.
If reset & reinstall, it has all project data in this device ony.
Thats why my submission is late.I'm verry sorry about disappointing you.
GitHub cant accept that much of files via drag/uploading.So i decide to compress and upload single zip file,I hope kindly check it.
Thank you.

# Project Idea

The idea of this project is to make a grocery android app that users can use to order the groceries they want. It doesn't contain any backend it is only android front end, but it will contain login athentication with firebase.

# Extensions

I have also created a screen to preview the previous orders total and date
